# Quick Sort Program

## Description

This project consists of two programs:

1. **`numberGen`**: Generates a large number of integers and writes them to `input.txt`.
2. **`sortNumber`**: Reads the integers from `input.txt`, sorts them using the Quick Sort algorithm, and writes the sorted integers to `result.txt`.

Together, these programs demonstrate the use of dynamic memory allocation and sorting algorithms in C.

## Features

- **Generate Integers**: The `numberGen` program generates integers and writes them to `input.txt`.
- **Sort Integers**: The `sortNumber` program reads integers from `input.txt`, sorts them using Quick Sort, and writes the sorted integers to `result.txt`.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation to handle large datasets.


## Usage

### 1. Generate Input File

First, run the `numberGen` program to generate the `input.txt` file with integers.

### 2. Run the sortNumber Program
Run the `sortNumber` program to sort the integers and generates `result.txt`.

### 3. Output
See the `result.txt` file for the result.
